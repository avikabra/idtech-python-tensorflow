# idtech-python-tensorflow
This repository has code from an introductory course to Python and Machine Learning in ID Tech. In it are some basic test programs (like ifelse.py and operators.py), larger algorithms (like selectoinSort.py and diceGame.py), my Pong final project (pong.py), and a tensor flow programs that utilized MNIST and Cifar-10 Data to perform machine-learning analysis and to implement linear regression models.
