TENSORFLOW
    tensors flowing from one neuron to another
Placeholders
    a = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=[constraint rows, constraint column, constraint number of matrices]) (None, no quotation marks)
Variables
    b = tf.constant('value', dtype = tf.float32) (datatype)
Session (running the operation)
    eg.
    multiply = a*b
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        print(sess.run("thing you want to print", feed_dict={a:'13', b:'10'}))


Dictionaries:
    stores keys and values
    Elements = {"Atomic Number 1": "Hydrogen", "Atomic Number 5": "Boron"}
    Elements["Atomic Number 5"] (returns Boron)

Image Recognition
    images made of pixels
    pixels have a rgb color
    images are seen as a matrix of color values by computers
